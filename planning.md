# Snowman

I will be writing an algorithm to enable a user to purchase a number of books from the Wizarding Series, and the discounted price displayed to the buyer.

I will be basing this algorithm on the algorithm written for the workbook assignment earlier in the term, with the major difference that it will be used over a network, rather than on a single computer.

## Classes

The classes & sub classes will be:
* Shopping List - a class to ask the buyer how many of each book they wish to purchase
* Book Sets - a class to organise the list of books into sets so that the appropriate discount can be applied
* Full Price - a class to calculate the cost of the books with no discount(s) applied
* Discount - a class to calculate the price of the books with appropriate discount(s) applied
* Print Price - a class to display for the buyer the total cost of their purchase
