I will be writing an algorithm to enable two people to be able to play a game of Snowman, which I created last term but will be modifying.

I will need to create a server which allows 2 clients to connect to it, and the clients.

The classes & sub classes will be:
* Server
* Game
* Snowscene
* Player
    * Challenger
    * Guesser
* Word
